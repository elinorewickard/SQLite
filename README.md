# Relational Database

The table I am using is pretty simple. It is called library and holds the columns: title, author, & last_read. These are all text/char values.

# Development Environment

VS Code

sqlite3

# Useful Websites

* [SQLite Turtorial](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/)

# Future Work

* Allow more columns to be updated in table
